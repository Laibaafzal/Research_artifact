# Function to generate NER labels
def generate_ner_labels(text):
    prompt = f"""
You are a language model trained to assist with Named Entity Recognition (NER).
Tokenize the following sentence and label each token using the BIO format for NER.

The following entity types should be recognized:
- B-PER (Person)
- I-PER (Person, continuation)
- B-ORG (Organization)
- I-ORG (Organization, continuation)
- B-LOC (Location)
- I-LOC (Location, continuation)
- B-DATE (Date)
- I-DATE (Date, continuation)
- B-ACT (Action)
- B-EMO (Emotion)
- B-SPIRIT (Spiritual Entity: God, angel, ghost, spirit)
- B-ROLE (Role)
- O (Other)

Consider the following guidelines for labeling:
1. **Person (B-PER)**: Names of people, characters, or any entity representing a person.
2. **Organization (B-ORG)**: Names of companies, institutions, etc.
3. **Location (B-LOC)**: Geographical locations such as cities, countries, landmarks, etc.
   - **Note**: If "worlds" refers to a collection of planets or a geographical setting (e.g., "worlds in the galaxy"), label it as **B-LOC**.
   - **Note**: If "worlds" refers to a fictional or metaphorical idea (e.g., "worlds of possibilities"), label it as **O**.
4. **Date (B-DATE)**: Specific dates or time references (e.g., January 1st, 2025).
5. **Action (B-ACT)**: Action verbs such as "went", "ran", "achieved", etc.
6. **Emotion (B-EMO)**: Emotional states such as "happy", "sad", "angry", "frustration" "jealousy" "love" etc.
7. **Spiritual Entities (B-SPIRIT)**: Spiritual entities such as "God", "angel", "ghost", "spirit", etc. **Only these specific words** should be labeled as **B-SPIRIT**.
   - Example: "God" → **B-SPIRIT**, "Angel" → **B-SPIRIT**, "Ghost" → **B-SPIRIT**, "Spirit" → **B-SPIRIT**
8. **Other (O)**: Non-entity tokens, such as stop words or punctuation, and general terms like "worlds" (if not referring to spiritual realms).
**Important: Do not break contractions or possessives like "he'll", "we're", "they're", "John's", etc. Treat them as single tokens.**

Here is an example of how you should structure the output:
{{
  "tokens": ["John", "went", "to", "New", "York", "on", "January", "1st", "."],
  "labels": ["B-PER", "O", "O", "B-LOC", "I-LOC", "O", "B-DATE", "I-DATE", "O"]
}}
Now process the following sentence:
"{text}"
Return only a valid JSON response.
Do not include any explanations, extra text, or markdown formatting. Return only a valid JSON object.
